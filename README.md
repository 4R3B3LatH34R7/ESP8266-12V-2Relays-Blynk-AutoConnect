ESP01-DC12V-2Relays-Blynk

This board was bought on shopee.sg at SGD7.24 excluding shipping. ESP01 included.
Device is OK with DC12V.
I cannot get the original firmware onboard the included ESP8266 to get working with instructions on shopee product page.
Searched online at LCTech website and many others.
I just can't understand the English instructions that they provided.
But found a zip file on mediafire and baidu which contain many information and apps.
An example ino was also found on GitHub outlining how Serial.write was used to send hex codes to control the relays.
I thought the relays were controlled by IO pins.
Adapted my code to get the board to work with Blynk. WiFi Config will be added in another commit soon.
Started learning about GitHub too.
